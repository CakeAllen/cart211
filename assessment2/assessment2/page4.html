            Web 4.0 is often envisioned as the “ubiquitous Web” or “Intelligent Web”, where artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT) are fully integrated into daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this stage, the Web becomes a seamless environment in which humans, devices, and intelligent agents interact continuously. Personalized assistants, autonomous systems, and real-time machine learning make the Web highly adaptive and context-aware.
